initLab Logo
============

Just a repo containing the vector version of initLab's logo along with a handy
Makefile

Dependencies
------------

To use the Makefile you will need Inkscape and ImageMagick.

Instructions
------------

Just run `make` and the script will generate a PNG version of the logo, a bunch
of differently-sized PNG favicons and an ICO file containing the 16x16 and 32x32
versions of the logo.
